# Facial Emotion Detection using CNN

A deep learning project that detects and classifies human emotions from facial expressions in real-time using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Built using TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV, the model is trained on the FER-2013 dataset and supports real-time webcam-based emotion recognition.

## Features

- Custom CNN architecture for multi-class emotion detection  
- Trained on the FER-2013 dataset  
- Real-time detection via webcam using OpenCV  
- Seven emotion classes: Angry, Disgusted, Fearful, Happy, Neutral, Sad, Surprised  
- Modular, easy-to-understand code for future enhancement and experimentation

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
