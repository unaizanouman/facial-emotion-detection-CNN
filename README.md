# facial-emotion-detection-CNN
A deep learning project that detects and classifies human emotions from facial expressions in real-time using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Built using TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV, the model is trained on the FER-2013 dataset and supports real-time webcam-based emotion recognition.
